# Headline Slider

There are some news headlines to be displayed within an animated slider.

## learning objectives

 * DOM operations handled in an asynchronous manner

## the task

Create a visual component which will include 3 headlines that will rotate in a loop:
 * the top one gets hidden
 * a new one appears at the bottom
 * timeout delay and repeat

## howto

 * __data__: you can grab the data either from [this static file](headlines.json) or [generate some new ones](http://json-schema-faker.js.org/#gist/bc9a461974082bd4d7cb21f4e2d32815).
 * __animations, DOM processing__: most people know jQuery, and so it's already included in the boilerplate (v3.1). But feel free to replace with whatever else.
 * __async__: choose the approach you want: callbacks, promises, coroutines. Preferably, try them all and compare the result.
